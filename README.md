# Bitcamp-Data-Viewer
Oculus + Leap Motion VR Data Mapper
An immersive data-viewing demo using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion to allow people to engage the spatial context with which demographic data is inevitably entangled. We use the Hovercast VR Menu plugin provided on the LeapMotion website plus our own event handlers to render data from CSV files to a map of Washington DC without ever requiring an external controller or keyboard.
